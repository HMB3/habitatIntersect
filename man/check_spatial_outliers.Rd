\title{This function takes a data frame of all taxa records,
flags records as spatial outliers (T/F for each record in the df), and saves images of the checks for each.
Manual cleaning of spatial outliers is very tedious, but automated cleaning makes mistakes, so checking is handy
It uses the CoordinateCleaner package https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CoordinateCleaner/index.html.
It assumes that the input dfs are those returned by the coord_clean_records function}
\usage{
check_spatial_outliers(
  all_df,
  site_records,
  land_shp,
  clean_path,
  plot_points,
  record_limit,
  spatial_mult,
  prj
)
}
\arguments{
\item{all_df}{Data.frame. DF of all taxa records returned by the coord_clean_records function}

\item{land_shp}{R object. Shapefile of the worlds land (e.g. https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/10m-land/)}

\item{clean_path}{Character string -  The file path used for saving the checks}

\item{spatial_mult}{Numeric. The multiplier of the interquartile range (method == 'quantile', see ?cc_outl)}

\item{site_df}{Data.frame of site records (only used if you have site data, e.g. I-naturalist)}
}
\value{
Data.frame of taxa records, with spatial outlier T/F flag for each record
}
