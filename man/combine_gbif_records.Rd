\title{This function combines all occurrence files from GBIF into one table.
There are slight differences between ALA and GBIF, so separate functions are useful.
It assumes that all the files come from the previous GBIF downloads function.
Although you can download all the records for in one go, this is better for
Doing small runs of taxa, or where you want to re-run them constantly}
