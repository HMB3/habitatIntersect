The text and code below summarises a workflow in R that can be used to relatively rapidly assess the environmental range of a species within Australia, from downloading occurrence records, through to creating maps of predicted climatic suitability across Australia at 1km*1km resolution. An example of this work is published in the journal Science of the Total Environment ::

under climate change. Science of The Total Environment, 685, 451-462.

To install, run :

```{r message=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Function to load or install packages
ipak <- function(pkg){
  new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
  if (length(new.pkg))
    install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE, repos="https://cran.csiro.au/")
  sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)
}

## These packages are not on cran, but are needed
# library(devtools)
# install_github('johnbaums/things')
# install_github('johnbaums/rmaxent')
# install_github('traitecoevo/taxonlookup')

## Main package 
# devtools::install_github("HMB3/nenswniche")

## Load packages

# STEP 8 :: Aggregate SDM projections within Spatial units

\

Now that all the species models and projections have been run, we need to aggregate them 
across all six global circulation models. In order to aggregate the results, we need 
a shapefile to aggregate to. In this example, we'll use the Australian Significant Urban 
Areas, which were used in the Stoten article. A geo-tif of the Significant Areas is on 
Google drive:

\


```{r message=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Can't use the .rda, must use the file path
areal_unit_vec <- shapefile_vector_from_raster(shp_file = SUA,
                                               prj      = CRS("+init=EPSG:3577"),
                                               agg_var  = 'SUA_CODE16',
                                               temp_ras = aus.grids.current[[1]],
                                               targ_ras = './data/SUA_2016_AUST.tif')

## This is a vector of all the cells that either are or aren't in the rasterized shapefile
summary(areal_unit_vec)

``` 

\

This aggregation function uses the 10th% Logistic threshold for each species 
from the maxent models to threshold the rasters of habitat suitability (0-1) 
For each GCM. For each species, it sums the 6 GCMS to create a binary raster with 
cell values between 0-6. These cell values represent the number of GCMs where that 
cell had a suitability value above the threshold determined by maxent. We classify 
a cell has suitable if it met the threshold in > 4 GCMs, and use this combined 
raster to compare current and future suitability, measuring if the suitability 
of each cell is changing over time, remaining stable or was never suitable
It assumes that the maxent predictions were generated by the 'project_maxent_grids_mess'  
function. Note that this step is quite memory heavy, and is best run with 32GB of RAM.

         ## If the species fails, write a fail message to file.
         error = function(cond) {
           
           ## This will write the error message inside the text file,
           file.create(file.path("output/maxent/back_sel_models/sua_count_failed_2030.txt"))
           cat(cond$message,

**Figure 3.** Example of a combined map of change in climatic suitability from current conditions to 2070. 
Species occurrence points are plotted in red on the left panel. The cells in the right and bottom panels 
are coded as either lost (orange cells - present now but not in 2070 according to 4 or more GCMs), 
gained (green cells - absent now, but present in 2070), stable (blue cells - present now and in 2070), 
or never suitable (white cells - never present).
